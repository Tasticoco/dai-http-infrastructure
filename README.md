### NGinx configuration

Here is our configuration file for nginx, it is simply named 'nginx.conf' : 

```nginx configuration
# Our incredible nginx configuration file

# This is a http server
# We don't need to add the http directive because it is the default one
server {
    listen 80; # The port the server listens
    server_name vaches.ch; # The domain name of the server
    root /var/www/html; # The root directory of the server

    # The context that define what to fetch when being on vaches.ch/
    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ =404; # if the file isn't found, return 404
    }
}

```
