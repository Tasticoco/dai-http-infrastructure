## Introduction

In this project, we will create a HTTP infrastructure using Docker and NGinx. We will also create a CRUD API using Javalin.
The theme of this project is the franchise Monster Hunter and we'll use our API to manage monsters. Check the API section for more information
about the operations we can do on monsters.

## Documentation

### NGinx configuration

Here is our configuration file for nginx, it is simply named 'nginx.conf' : 

```nginx configuration
# Our incredible nginx configuration file

# This is a http server
# We don't need to add the http directive because it is the default one
server {
    listen 80; # The port the server listens
    server_name vaches.ch; # The domain name of the server
    root /var/www/html; # The root directory of the server

    # The context that define what to fetch when being on vaches.ch/
    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ =404; # if the file isn't found, return 404
    }
}

```

### Docker compose file

Here is our docker compose file, it is simply named 'docker-compose.yml' :

```docker-compose
version: '3.8'

services:
  nginx:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    image: nginx:stable
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
    volumes:
      - ./nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
      - ./website/troweld-html:/var/www/html

```
